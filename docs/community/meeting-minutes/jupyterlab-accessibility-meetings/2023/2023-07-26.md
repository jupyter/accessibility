### Agenda

* Gabriel's update: finishing up deliverables for [CZI JupyterLab accessibility grant](https://jupyter-accessibility.readthedocs.io/en/latest/funding/czi-grant-roadmap.html), which is coming to an end. This includes pushing forward on [fixing tab traps](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-a11y-mgmt/issues/134), [fixing focus management](https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino/pull/607) in the Lumino menubar, finishing up a [focus visible regression test](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-a11y-testing/pull/33), and [creating accessibility docs](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/14426).
* Isabela
    * [JupyterLab user testing results are up for review.](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/JupyterLab-user-testing/pull/10). Once merged I'll pass a PR over to [jupyter/surveys](https://github.com/jupyter/surveys) as well for continuity.
    * [Notebooks for all (STScI) user testing results have a PR to add to jupyter/surveys](https://github.com/jupyter/surveys/pull/26). 
    * I'm working on getting the Notebooks for all (STScI) proposal document into jupyter/accessibility's proposal directory so we keep building references for funding accessibility work in Jupyter.
    * I spoke about accessibile notebook authoring recommendations at SciPy (conference). The recording is supposed to be up shortly. You can have [the slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LBcEOGhZfLXCaGAWUaGl4c6O5AXBBXzfoA9dV0W-5Pc/edit?usp=sharing).
    * [JupyterLab accessibility statement PR](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/14856)
* T & P and Tony
    * Community event updates
    * Looking for review on [What does accessibility mean for Jupyter?
A Jupyter Community Event proposal
](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m5-fiqWVdlqOuKjp4auakG0MMaTii7JdCVyjwKU7uQU/edit#heading=h.ksli8dqlx0ec)
* T & P
    * Following PRs are open it would be great to get these merged as well as tht latest version of lumino into Jupyterlab asin combination they cover a significant amount of keyboard and zoom accessibility
        * [400% Zoom screen usability enhancements - Updated](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/14766/)
        * [Keyboard navigation right sidebar shortcut command](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/14799)

    * We are working on 
        * Screen reader compatibility with keyboard navigation 
        * Aria announcements for command palette executions
    * Note
        * [CSS Style Validator](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/14795) may cause some issues with complex CSS for accessibility notes in ticket on a workaround
* Ely
    * (Special?) meeting time that works for Gabriela
        * Perhaps we can move this meeting to 9am Pacific on Thursdays every other week (and alternating with Jupyter Server contributing hour), Darian will raise this issue at tomorrow's Jupyter Server and Kernels call
* blog post
  * testing is ill defined. we need to work on our definitions
  * [Gab] trying to integrate feedback from Isabela, I'm guessing that probably the blog post needs messaging around the idea that, okay, here we are down the line, we've closed a bunch of accessibility-labeled PRs in a Notebook 7 milestone that came out of auditing the software, but that does not ladder up to certainty that the software is for sure more accessible (without user feedback and user testing)
