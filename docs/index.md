# Jupyter Accessibility

🔔 Looking for [accessibility docs?](accessibility-docs)

Welcome to the Team Compass for the Jupyter Accessibility [software subproject](https://jupyter.org/governance/software_subprojects.html).

This subproject was formed in early 2019.
Its goal is to gather stakeholders interested in working to make Jupyter's
core user-facing software and related tooling accessible.

These core user-facing software include:

- [Classic Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook)
- [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab)
- [JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub)

## Accessibility Status for Jupyter tools

```{warning}
As of January 2023 this software **is not accessible**.
Significant work will be required to reach that goal.
```

In the meantime, you can read the
[JupyterLab accessibility statement](../resources/JupyterLab-a11y-statement.md)
to get a better understanding of its state and limitations.
