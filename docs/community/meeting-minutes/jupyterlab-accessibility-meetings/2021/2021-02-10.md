### What are people working on?

- Keyboard shortcuts and default keyboard navigation with assistive
  devices. This Came up with this PR JLab
  [#9031](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/9031) but it
  seems like it could be a bigger discussion for understanding how
  these things interact now and in the future.

  - Thanks to Thomas for replying here!

- Max has been working on a new filebrowser. Trying to bake
  accessibility in on a low level. Issue with notes:

  - https://github.com/jpmorganchase/regular-table/issues/114
  - Using the WAI ARIA spec for grid and table properties. These
    not only need regular labels, but also descriptions for how they
    are nested and a flag for the position.
  - Max would like feedback/for someone to test it with a screenreader.
  - This is a really helpful exploration that should help us with
    other tables used in JupyterLab. Further references with a [treegrid
    example](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/examples/treegrid/treegrid-1.html)
    are here.

- Question on Max's [lumino PR](https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino/pull/132)
  conflicts with https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/9622 - Martha reviewed it and is clarifying what labels they are using
  across PRs so that they are consistent.

- Martha's PR at [#9622](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/9622)
  is ready for final review and to be merged after one more commit
  to match labels across PRs.

- Nick
  - For testing: pa11y -s, --standard <name> the accessibility
    standard to use: Section508 (U.S. focused), WCAG2A, WCAG2AA
    (default), WCAG2AAA – only used by htmlcs runner
  - numfocus GSoC team would be a solid team for working on
    accessibility docs

### Other Notes

- Isabela opened
  - [#9742](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/9742)
    because I've had some people asking me about accessibility tests
    elsewhere and I wanted a place to collect the discussion as it
    relates to JLab.
  - an issue on the accessibility repo about best practices for
    [accessibility docs](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/issues/15)
- As a last check, remember to ask yourself if things need to be
  translated. - ARIA values usually need it - Table headers might need to be translated? This is worth
  further research. - Data in a table does not need to be.
- Funding discussion
  - Possible Canadian grant: https://accessible.canada.ca/advancing-accessibility-standards-research/funding
  - NSF, NIH, DoE (both of them) NSF future of work https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2021/nsf21548/nsf21548.htm
  - Does documentation seem like a good project to get outside
    help on?
- Accessibility workshop updates! There isn't something we can
  share now, but people are working on it and there should be
  updates in the next few weeks.

### Merged PRs (let's celebrate!)

- Tony merged [#9648](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/9648)!
