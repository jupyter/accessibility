## Agenda 

* [name=Gabriel] Possible office hours question: keyboard shortcuts registered via the JupyterLab command registry are handled on the capture phase, but I have always worked in apps that use bubbling. 
    * Why are keyboard shortcuts implemented how they are?
        * chord shortcuts were applied. it is a emacs feature. helps entice emacs users in jupyter.
        * support chords
        * css specificity
        * people implement their own keyboard action when it is not a command. 
            * use case: a mini list to make up down l r work.
    * How are keyboard shortcuts handled?
        * keyboard shortcuts are composed and executed by the command registry.
        * this happens at the lumino application layer.
        * [specificity versus matchability](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/blob/b7c241483ec8562eb2a836ebc86086d04597aa4a/packages/shortcuts-extension/src/index.ts#L51-L79)
* [name=william] A little motivated by Darian's comment last hour: I'm curious about the accessibility implications of being able to move buttons around in toolbars, reorder menus, etc.   It can be confusing because customization has a scope with web apps that is a lot different than say "photoshop".
* [name=tonyfast] semantic tags for notebooks and cells
    * Could a [rendered notebook (static HTML page) be described by aria role=feed](https://iota-school.github.io/notebooks-for-all/exports/Imaging_Sky_Background_Estimation-form-based.html)?
