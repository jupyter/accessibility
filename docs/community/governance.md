# Jupyter Accessibility Governance

Jupyter Accessibility is a [Project Jupyter Software Subproject](https://jupyter.org/governance/list_of_subprojects.html). 

The [jupyter/accessibility](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility) repository serves as our project's team compass, our central location for effort coordination, updates, and governance.

## Subproject-specific governance

The Jupyter Accessibility subproject follows the [Project Jupyter Software Subproject documentation](https://jupyter.org/governance/software_subprojects.html). Additional aspects of governance left to our subproject's own discretion are listed here.

### Software Steering Council representative

As a Software Subproject, the Jupyter Accessibility council elects one council member to be the project's representative to the [Project Jupyter Software Steering Council (SSC)](https://jupyter.org/governance/software_steering_council.html).

- The term length for a Jupyter Accessibility SSC representative is one year. Elections are to be run within the council annually.
- There is no cap on number of terms served by a Jupyter Accessibility SSC representative. There is no limit on consecutive terms served.
