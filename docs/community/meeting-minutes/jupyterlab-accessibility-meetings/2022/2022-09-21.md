- Most recent Zoom audit in JupyterLab and findings https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyterlab-accessible-themes/issues/34
- Examples of manual-testing scripts we are working on https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-a11y-testing/tree/main/testing/scripts
- Darian: is happy to offer office hours to help folks orient around the codebase
    - Ely: had plenty support from Jason when walking this path 
    - Ely: some helpful information was around panel, CSS, historical context (from Jason), panels needed for a particular situation
    - Provide examples of extensions with the panels/layout explanations (maybe in the readme in Lumino)
    - Tania: could we look at codetours for example? https://github.com/microsoft/codetour
- Adjacent: Tania proposed this docs reorg (JupyterLab) https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/7387
- Darian: proposal -> use some of these calls to do "BBQ bonanza/triage" -> find where the issue resides to help fixing this
