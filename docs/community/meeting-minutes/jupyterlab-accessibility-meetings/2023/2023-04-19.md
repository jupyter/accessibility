### Agenda

* turns out there are more guidelines beyond WCAG for authoring tools. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/"><abbr title="Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines">ATAG</abbr></a> are guidelines specific for accessible authoring experiences. ATAG is part of series of guidelines including WCAG and <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/uaag/"><abbr title="User Agent Accessibility Guidelines">UAAG</abbr></a>.
    * [We haven't talked about these since 2021!](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/blob/main/docs/community/meeting-minutes/jupyterlab-accessibility-meetings/all-minutes.md#061621-meeting-minutes)
* Chartability for ensuring that data visualizations, systems, and interfaces are accessible.  https://github.com/Chartability/POUR-CAF
* [Do No Harm Guide: Applying Equity Awareness in Data Visualization](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/do-no-harm-guide-applying-equity-awareness-data-visualization)
* Request for a place where we can track/compare different recommendations. Venn diagram-style?
* Interest in having a list of the status of different guidelines. ie. number out of total number guideline compliance per set.
* Isabela was working on a JupyterLab accessibility statement - think keeping that updated to report on effort would be a good step
