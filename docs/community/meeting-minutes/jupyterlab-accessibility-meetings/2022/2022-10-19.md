### Agenda

- Isabela 
    - Discussion on directions for high browser zoom and JupyterLab at [jupyterlab/jupyterlab #10004](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/10004#issuecomment-1276957564). Please weigh in! 
        - Mike: Another approach would be to have UI and document zoom approached separately since it is possible they are different use cases.
        - Mike: "A datapoint for previous discussion: in VScode the default is to zoom everything and user needs to enable document zooming manually though they divide ctrl + scroll as it seems."
    - For anyone curious, here is what we did [on the collaborative keyboard navigation review for the Notebook 7 prerelease](https://github.com/isabela-pf/a11y-events/pull/10). It will become an issue elsewhere.

- Gabriel
    - Sneak peek on some of the work I'm doing. tl;dr-- Run accessibility regression tests via GitHub Actions against a JupyterLab PR, showing if it breaks (or fixes) any regression tests.

- Copy this to next meeting's agenda: For the remainining meeting time, can we open up and dig into CodeMirror? -Gabriel
[name=Tania] I am interested in this, mostly how can we "test" for the newly introduced accessibility features
