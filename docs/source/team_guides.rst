Team Guides
===========

Standards and resources
-----------------------

One of our goals is to collect information about accessibility and create documentation to empower the Jupyter community 
to help us make our software accessible. Please use this section to begin to aggregate relevant third party standards, 
guides, and documentation related to this:

* `Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/>`_ - W3C Recommendation
* `The A11 Project <https://a11yproject.com/>`_
* `18F Accessibility Guide <https://accessibility.18f.gov/>`_
* `The tota11y toolbar <https://khan.github.io/tota11y/>`_ is a lightweight javascript toolbar for quick a11y analysis.
* `The WAVE tool <http://wave.webaim.org/report#/http://z2jh.jupyter.org/>`_ is a web analyzer for page accessibility.

Jupyter a11y tech
-----------------
`Jupyter Notebook a11y toolbar <https://github.com/uclixnjupyternbaccessibility/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/tree/master/src/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/nbextensions/accessibility_toolbar>`_ (from Microsoft research)

Accessibility related issues
----------------------------
A number of open issue related to accessibility are already open on the repos above. 
Please help us to aggregate links to those here. 
The preferred way to do this is for each repo to have a unique GitHub label for accessibility, 
and then to link to the GitHub issue search that automatically lists those issues:

* `Jupyter Notebook Accessibility Issues <https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Atag%3AAccessibility>`_
* `JupyterHub Accessibility Issues <https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aaccessibility>`_
* `JupyterLab Accessibility Issues <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Atag%3AAccessibility>`_
