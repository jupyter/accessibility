# Community Calls and Events

## Get Connected with the Community

First off, get yourself connected with the Jupyter Accessibility community online.
There are a few places where we have conversations and discussion.

- [Accessibility section of the Community forum][discourse-accessibility] - ongoing conversations and brainstorms around accessibility in the Jupyter ecosystem.
- [Jupyter Notebook Accessibility Issues][notebook-accessibility-issues] - all the `tag:Accessibility` issues in the Jupyter Notebook repository.
- [JupyterHub Accessibility Issues][jupyterhub-accessibility-issues] - all the `label:Accessibility` issues in the JupyterHub repository.
- [JupyterLab Accessibility Issues][jupyerlab-accessibility-issues] - all the `tag:Accessibility` issues in the JupyterLab repository.
- Review and join in contributing to [accessibility issues identified for the ongoing CZI EOSS grant](../funding/czi-grant-roadmap.md)

```{important}
As a reminder, we expect all members of the Jupyter Accessibility community to adhere to the [Jupyter Code of Conduct][jupyter-coc] in these conversations.
```

## Meetings

The Jupyter Accessibility and [Jupyter Frontends](https://github.com/jupyterlab/frontends-team-compass) subprojects meet together on Zoom once a week. 
Please bring your accessibility-related updates, ideas, issues, concerns, and questions to that call. 
Members of the Jupyter Accessibility subproject will make a particular effort to attend the first meeting of each calendar month.
These meetings are open to anyone, whether you are interested in discussing a topic or listening in.
