### Agenda

- Tony: https://github.com/Iota-School/notebooks-for-all/pull/49 shows progress on a semantic html5 structure for notebook webpages. in this approach, we treat the rendered version of the notebook as an entire interactive web page.
    - please leave feedback on comments in the pull request
    - in this structure
        - the notebook occupies the `main` tag
            - the each cell is a row in a `table`
                - the cell is represented by form components
    -  this approach surfaces interactive elements like links, forms, and overflowing elements to drive focus. it gives a more meaningful navigation experience of rendered notebooks zoomed in, on a screen, and navigated with tabs.
    -  this representation could serve as a starting point for the proper roles and aria for interactive implementations to improve their accessible experience.
