# Community Calls and Events

````{note}
The Jupyter Accessibility project was recently converted into an [official Jupyter Software Subproject](https://jupyter.org/governance/software_subprojects.html).
We are currently working on our governance and decision making, please bear with us while we get this sorted.
``
## Get Connected with the Community

First off, get yourself connected with the Jupyter Accessibility community online.
There are a few places where we have conversations and discussion.

- [Accessibility section of the Community forum][discourse-accessibility] - ongoing conversations and brainstorms around accessibility in the Jupyter ecosystem.
- [Jupyter Notebook Accessibility Issues][notebook-accessibility-issues] - all the `tag:Accessibility` issues in the Jupyter Notebook repository.
- [JupyterHub Accessibility Issues][jupyterhub-accessibility-issues] - all the `label:Accessibility` issues in the JupyterHub repository.
- [JupyterLab Accessibility Issues][jupyerlab-accessibility-issues] - all the `tag:Accessibility` issues in the JupyterLab repository.
- Review and join in contributing to [accessibility issues identified for the ongoing CZI EOSS grant](../funding/czi-grant-roadmap.md)

```{note}
As a reminder, we expect all members of the Jupyter Accessibility community to adhere to the [Jupyter Code of Conduct][jupyter-coc] in these conversations.

## Team meetings and notes

The Jupyter Accessibility meets every two weeks to discuss what we have been up to, discuss important issues, make decisions, share ideas, and enjoy one another’s company.
These meetings are open to anyone, whether you are interested in discussing a topic or listening in.
