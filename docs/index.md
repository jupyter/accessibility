# Jupyter Accessibility

Welcome to the Team Compass for the Jupyter Accessibility project.

This group was formed in early 2019.
Its goal is to gather stakeholders interested in working to make Jupyter's
core user-facing software and related tooling accessible.

These core user-facing software include:

- [Classic Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook)
- [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab)
- [JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub)

## Accessibility Status for Jupyter tools

```{warning}
As of August 2022 this software **is not accessible**.
Significant work will be required to reach that goal.
```

In the meantime, you can read the JupyterLab accessibility statement to get a better understanding of its state and limitations:

## Using Jupyter Software with Assistive Technology

If you are trying to use Jupyter tools with assistive technology now, you may be able to get basic support with the following:

- [Jupyter Notebook a11y toolbar](https://github.com/uclixnjupyternbaccessibility/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/tree/master/src/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/nbextensions/accessibility_toolbar) (from Microsoft research)
- Make cells editable with a screen reader using the [NVDA Browser Nav add-on](https://addons.nvda-project.org/addons/browsernav.en.html#:~:text=BrowserNav%20addon%20for%20NVDA,comments%20or%20malformed%20HTML%20tables.”)
