### Notes

- There are overlap in infrastructure needs for an accessible
  JupyterLab and mobile/tablet support for JupyterLab. Maybe this
  is an opportunity to get more people involved in this work since
  there have been a lot of requests for mobile/tablet support.

Triage of existing accessibility issues
**This will be cross-referenced, updated with #9399, and stored
in this [project](https://github.com/orgs/jupyterlab/projects/1)
from here on out.**

- Reviewed from [diagram-codesprint/phosphor](https://github.com/diagram-codesprint/phosphor),
  [diagram-codesprint/jupyterlab](https://github.com/diagram-codesprint/jupyterlab),
  [phosphorjs/phosphor](https://github.com/phosphorjs/phosphor/),
  [jupyterlab/lumino](https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino/), and
  [jupyterlab/jupyterlab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/labels/tag%3AAccessibility)
  ([jupyter/accessibility](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/issues) has been more organizing focused).
- Isabela proposes continuing to focus on what was found in Hack4All first.
  - [#6577](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6577)
  - [#6578](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6578)
  - [#6579](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6579)
  - [#6580](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6580)
  - [#6581](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6581)
  - [#6582](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6582)
  - [#9365](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/9365) Follow up for jupyterlab/lumino #129 that applies isToggleable to JLab now that it is possible with Lumino (Martha started this!)
- Issues Isabela wants to look into more

  - JLab [#6575](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6575)
    (update of diagram-codesprint/jupyterlab #8) Has merged PR #6359, but
    didn’t close the issue.
  - JLab [#6576](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6576)
    (update of diagram-codesprint/jupyterlab #9) and [#6404](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6404) Looks like a reference for UX of these accessibility changes and proposed solutions.
  - JLab [#1095](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/1095)
    Visual/additional/any cues for running commands (this was to be put
    to phosphor, review if it was already done or not)
  - JLab [#911](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/911)
    An audit issue about what seems to be the first JLab
    accessibility review. I need to check if they are or need to be
    represented in other issues.
  - diagram-codesprint/phosphor [#2](https://github.com/diagram-codesprint/phosphor/pull/2)
    and [#3](https://github.com/diagram-codesprint/phosphor/pull/3)
    status. Did they get merged into Phosphor ever?
  - diagram-codesprint/jupyterlab [#4](https://github.com/diagram-codesprint/jupyterlab/pull/4)
    and [#11](https://github.com/diagram-codesprint/jupyterlab/pull/11) status.
    Did they ever get merged into JupyterLab?

- Other issues
  - [#6573](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6573)
    NVDA tests on JLab. (Not explicitly tied to Hack4All, but seems
    like it was part of it.)
  - [#4878](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/4878)
    Older screen reader evaluation with good discussion. Has been
    mentioned in a few issues and PRs so it would probably be good
    to brush up on.

#### What are people working on?

- Max and Jason
  - [jupyterlab/lumino#132](https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino/pull/132)
    still needs review.
- Thomas
  - Opened [#9399](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/9399)
  - This is a full review of JupyterLab accessibility, can be
    broken up into other issues as we go.
  - Evaluation is on JLab v.2.26 This should catch a lot of
    what holds over to 3.0, but we will be facing new problems
    with virtual notebook.
  - We started discussing how we pull this apart to tackle it
    - Tabs/tab order are the blockers that prevent further
      evaluation, so they should be high up on our list
    - Order top to bottom should work in order of what are
      most critical and/or rely on one another
  - This is a great review! Thank you so much!
- Isabela
  - Collecting and triaging existing issues as listed above.

#### Next Steps

- Max created a project to track JupyterLab accessibility work
  https://github.com/orgs/jupyterlab/projects/1. This will be how
  we organize and keep track of work in the future.
- Isabela and Tony will compare and consolidate #9399 with
  pre-existing issues. - Isabela also needs to check for duplicate issues and
  close/update as needed. - Triage marking by WCAG standard and maybe level of complexity?
- Martha #9365 applying isToggleable to JLab now that it is
  possible in Lumino is still happening. This will be her next step.
- Time to reach out to experts and say we want to meet in the
  future (also gives us a deadline for some of the commitments)
