### Agenda

- William: I'm curious if you have any thoughts about what happens when the cursor is at the top (or bottom) of a markdown cell and you hit the up (or down) arrow.  It goes to the previous cell instead of "staying in that form element".  Is this bad from an accessibility point of view?  A user complained today about this behavior to me, prompting [this issue](https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc/issues/6526).   Same question makes sense for code cells.    (Context: could there be a general "accessibility mode" for Jupyter notebook where the entire approach to navigation is much more standard and accessible, but maybe more awkward for experts?)
   - User: "I expect arrow keys to only move the cursor in the current form that is being edited."
    - [codepen](https://codepen.io/tonyfast/pen/NWLpdrB)
    - [WAI](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/)
    - Where to put accessibility configuration:
      - https://github.com/mozilla/readability
- Ely (if time): takeaways from Jupyter for Education Workshop
    * what format do professors provide students?
    * teaching and sharing formats are often not the same
    * export to html is common practice
    extensions help and cause problems
    * can fix things, but provide more code to be vulnerable to accessibility failings
    "slides in latex easier to read"
    * used to students saying "give me the source"
    * the need for alt text is there, but writing it is hard.
    * jupyter is the medium for teaching
- Isabela: Updates on JupyterLab accessibility user research. I'm still in the scheduling phase.
