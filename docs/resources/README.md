# General and `jupyter` specific accessibility resources

This folder is a place for Jupyter accessibility working group members to put documents (and links to documents) that they create for themselves in the process of learning, research, discovery, fact-finding, but that may be of value to a larger audience.

These documents are meant to be informative and descriptive only. They are **not** proposals or recommendations.

Links to documents:

- [Mapping JupyterLab's user interface to source code](map-jupyterlab-frontend-architecture/README.md)
- [Comparing JupyterLab and RetroLab](https://hackmd.io/@gabalafou/Syevi8mTF)
