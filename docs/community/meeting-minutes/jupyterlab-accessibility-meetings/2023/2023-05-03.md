### Agenda

* SSC + EC update contents (Ely)
    * Quanstack worked toward accessibility testing compliance https://blog.jupyter.org/improving-the-accessibility-of-jupyter-6c695db518d3
    * Quansight developed a theming extension with varying accessible themes  https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyterlab-accessible-themes - Defines a set of JupyterLab themes compliant to WCAG color standards. Currently we have color blindness friendly themes!
    * 400% Zoom audit - some fixes had already been included in both JupyterLab and Lumino 
    * Notebook 7 audit 
    * Notebooks for all is a collaboration with the Space Telescope Science Institute that  in including disabled people in the testing of Jupyter notebooks and improvements in notebooks accessibility. https://github.com/Iota-School/notebooks-for-all
    * [Gabriel] At Quansight Labs, we had an intern working on JupyterLab and accessibility and she wrote a [blog post about her internship](https://labs.quansight.org/blog/zoom-a11y-jupyterlab)
    * [Gabriel] Added some accessibility regression tests (tab traps, focus visible), working on making easy-to-use GitHub actions to run accessibility tests,  incubating at [Quansight-Labs/jupyter-a11y-testing](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-a11y-testing)
    * What is our group's purpose?
        * Consistency, fostering advocacy
    * What we want to say
        * Put accessibility concerns earlier (a11y in the planning phase)
            * and consider at every phase of development
        * We recognize that this is not simple to scope, but neither is security
        * Funding for events to teach developers about accessibility 
        * What happens if Jupyter fails to close accessibility gaps and ed institutions are forced to not use it?
* Gabriel's update:
    * Took a PR out of draft mode that [removes tab traps from the Notebook widget](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/14115)
        * On the PR there is a [discussion about how to style focus indicators on the code cell](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/14115#pullrequestreview-1409130132)
        * [Tony] https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/focus-indicators/
