### Agenda

- Gabriel
    - Discuss: "Jupyter Accessibility": 
        1. Group exercise: open your favorite search engine, type "Jupyter Accessibility"... where does it take you? what is the first thing you see? 
        2. Are we happy with this?
        3. If not, what do we need to do?
[name=Tania] - we need docs like https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/accessibility for Lab and friends
[name=Mike] - Collect a list of extensions and themes for accessibility features see https://jupyter-accessibility.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#using-jupyter-software-with-assistive-technology
Comments included that we don't have user-focused documentation to point to. Even if they live on a per project basis, it makes sense to also have them here.
    - Some take-aways:
        1. Keep jupyter/accessibility as one repo. Donâ€™t split into two repos (one for user-facing docs, one for team compass)
        2. Put sign posts for end users in jupyter/accessibility repo and website.
        3. Try to add accessibility docs to jupyter.org and/or JupyterLab ReadTheDocs
        4. Push forward the work done on the Accessibility statement, with an eye to providing useful info for disabled users.
        5. Think about restructuring current docs so that they address different users: contributors, end users, maintainers, and such.
        6. Repos that use the keyword accessibility but are incomplete or works in progress sohuld probably have some kind of WIP label and preamble.

    - Want to fix the broken link to our old meeting notes? Help with [jupyter/accessibility #113](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/issues/113) is welcome!
    - I want to review and (if needed) update the [accessibility project board](https://github.com/orgs/jupyterlab/projects/1) soon. Is anyone interested in giving this a review as well? We can split issues up to save time.
