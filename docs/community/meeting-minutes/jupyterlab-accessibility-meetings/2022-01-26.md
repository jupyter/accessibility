### What are people working on?

- Tony https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/issues/67
    - What jupyter/accessibility has been so far: kind of a cross-project team compass
    - This PR discusses ways to make it a more resource-focused and active repo. Also to help people actually start using Jupyter tools (that's been a popular ask)
- Patrick
    - Could anyone give an update on how things are currently working, perhaps both high level and in the code?
    - People are interested! We need to follow up and connect these communities
    - Are these communities also willing to giving feedback on how to make better experiences (not just be WCAG compliant) based on how they use these tools?
- Isabela
    - Jupyter accessibility workshop summary/things to do
    - Alt text PRS from the workshop (still in progress until the end of this week)
        - https://github.com/isabela-pf/jupyter/pull/1
        - https://github.com/isabela-pf/jupyter.github.io/pull/1
- Gabriel
    - Does the [JupyterLab settings UI PR](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/11079) add accessibility features/is that a place they could go in the future?
    - Right now? That's not the focus. It could be added in the future.

### Next steps
- Discuss [jupyter/accessibility reorganization](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/issues/67) (open for commenting to everyone!)
- Follow up on cross-community collaboration (Isabela, Jenn, Tony, Patrick)
- Remove hardcoded css colors to improve the extensibility of the these (maybe Nick?)
