### Agenda

- Mike:
    - Shadow DOM
- Jeremy:
    - A new pre-release of Notebook 7 is available: https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/releases/tag/v7.0.0a6
    - Discourse topic: https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/notebook-7-pre-releases-are-available/16063
    - It includes the switch to **CodeMirror 6** that landed in JupyterLab: https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/11638
    - Closed the old issue on the RetroLab repo that was about doing an accessibility audit on the RetroLab UI: https://github.com/jupyterlab/retrolab/issues/80. Now that the CodeMirror 6 update is available in a Notebook 7 pre-release it should be possible to make this audit with a document-oriented notebook UI.
    - There is no development happening in `jupyterlab/retrolab` anymore, improvements and fixes should be done in JupyterLab and Notebook 7.
    - Happy to help in the `jupyter/notebook` or `jupyter/accessibility`. Please report any issue if you find any, thanks!
    - Try it on Binder with this gist: https://gist.github.com/jtpio/d368ab89cee5123ecee60683115e15f3

- Frederic
    - [Improvements of tab panel labelledby](https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino/pull/407) - will be part of 3.5.0
    - Some related work with consistency of CSS variables between background color and text color:
        - [Link background colors and ui font colors in the style](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/13173)  
        This was seen when working on a [JupyterLab theme editor](https://github.com/HaudinFlorence/jupyterlab-theme-editor)

- Mike v2:
  - low hanging fruit good first issue for new contributors https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/13045

- Isabela
    - Office hours follow up (from last meeting)?
    - Council updates?
    - [Browser zoom support](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow.html)â€” [(early) ideas for JupyterLab?](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyterlab-accessible-themes/issues/34#issuecomment-1228911639)

- Gabriel
    - If we have time for office hours, can we chat about tab focus indicators and/or tab traps in code cells?

### Next steps
- Shadow DOM needs more research and/or a binder to test it in
- Explore [Notebook 7](https://gist.github.com/jtpio/d368ab89cee5123ecee60683115e15f3). [Report Notebook 7 issues](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues).
- Add "office hours" help for under agenda and make a queue of issues to pull from
