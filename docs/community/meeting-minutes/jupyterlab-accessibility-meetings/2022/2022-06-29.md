### What are people working on?

- Sylvain

  - [Codemirror 6 migration](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/11638) is ready for testing, accessibility perspective and otherwise.
  - Please test it with the binder link in the PR! Feedback is extremely welcome! Please note CM6's accessibility doesn't seem to be clearly documented.
  - Known issues we will not be addressing: LaTeX syntax highlighting does not yet exist

- Isabela

  - JupyterLab accessibility statement approach
  - I'm going to be working on theming soon. What are your dream themes? (ie. ideal accessible themes)
  - :bulb: colour-blind friendly - as many as possible?!, selective contrast, address [Irlen syndrome needs](https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/professional-practice/irlen-syndrome), monochrome

- Gabriel

  - I haven't been doing much Jupyter-related accessibility work lately, but I have been trying to implement accessibility-related CI/CD for the upcoming new Quansight website (quansight.com and labs.quansight.org), and I have been a bit surprised (but not surprised) that some of this stuff isn't more plug-and-play.
  - Quansight's new website is statically generated with Vercel. You might think that there would be some ready drop-in solution to run [pa11y-ci](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y-ci) or [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) against the pages in your site, but so far I haven't found it.

- Nikhil

  - Haven't been working on Jupyter-specific accessibility tickets (although I would like to dive in), but have been working on data viz accessibility! Continuing some prior research I worked on during school (w/ Doug Schepers, Frank Elavsky) on auto-generating summaries using NLPfor complex/reactive charts/graphs and also diving more into sonification ([Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/accessibility/accessibility-module)).
  - One of our research benchmarks: [Chart2Text: Generating Natural Language Explanations for Charts by Adapting the Transformer Model](https://github.com/JasonObeid/Chart2Text)
  - From @gabalafou: here's a [Colab using some sonification](https://colab.research.google.com/github/hassaku/colab-a11y-utils/blob/master/colab_a11y_util_example.ipynb)
  - https://allosphere.ucsb.edu/
  - https://astronify.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

- Mike
  - https://github.com/krassowski/jupyterlab-voice-control is now a thing, was demoed on previous JupyterLab meeting

### Next steps

- Collect requests for notebook and visualization standards in JupyterLab to figure out where that info may be best stored (Isabela)
- Create a list for requested JupyterLab accessible themes with status (Isabela)
- Update on static website testing set up (Gabriel)
- Watch the jupyter-lab-voice demo when it's on YouTube!
