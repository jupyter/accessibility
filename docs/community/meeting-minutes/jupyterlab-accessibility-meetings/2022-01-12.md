### What are people working on?

- Isabela
    - Jupyter accessibility workshops are upcoming on January 15, January 22, and two events in March.
    - Find all up-to-date links on the [Jupyter blog announcement post](https://blog.jupyter.org/join-us-for-the-jupyter-accessibility-workshops-part-1-133e0e522d1b)
- Gabriel
    - Mapping out and comparing frontend of JupyterLab and RetroLab
- Chadi
    - How to get involved with Jupyter accessibility work
        - Review tasks on the [JupyterLab accessibility project board](https://github.com/orgs/jupyterlab/projects/1)
        - Focus on documentation fixes. Some could be adding alt text, making sure things are up to date.
        - Make changes to documentation theming that supports accessibility across projects (find test background on https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/11803 and https://github.com/pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme/pull/548)
        - Open issues based on what isn't working for you! We're relying heavily on standards, but user feedback would be even better.
- Nick
    - exploring [robotframework-axelibrary](https://github.com/adiralashiva8/robotframework-axelibrary) as a thing to add to [JupyterLibrary](https://github.com/robots-from-jupyter/robotframework-jupyterlibrary)
        - should be possible to e.g. configure `Test Teardown` to `Collect Accessibility Violations`
            - ...and when error conditions arise
        - tag with violations which would bubble up to 
    - potentially blocked by limited maintainer effort on upstreams 
    - also have some data analysis tools for long-term ingest of many robot reports
    - both could be injected into e.g. [robotkernel](https://github.com/robots-from-jupyter/robotkernel/issues/72)
