### Agenda

- [Identify accessibility targets for Lumino 2 #341](https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino/issues/341)
  - Mike: `silentNotifications` support - there is a stale PR which has an accessibility related utility function for announcing changes, maybe worth pulling into in lumino https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/9031 it looks like a similar effort was attempted years ago for: https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6583
  - Changing divs to buttons? (+1 from Isabela on this)
  - Isabela: Does the labelling issue in [jupyterlab/jupyterlab #6581 Input fields in dialogs need to be labeled](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/6581) have roots in Lumino?
  - [name=gabriel] is DataGrid used in JupyterLab? Darian: CSV viewer, variables viewer(?), pandas dataframes - basically anywhere you see the "spreadsheet" component
  - question from Ely about accessibility of canvas (because datagrid uses canvas)
    - Isabela mentions/asks about Google Docs and Canvas. Link from Mike: https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/05/Google-Docs-Canvas-Based-Rendering-Update.html
  - [name=gabriel] what counts as API change beyond method names/signatures?
    - response from Darian: for example, CSS is considered API because we don't make it private
- Circle back on next steps for our subproject status: probably a council
- Theming status - [JLab 3.2.0 partial (non-color) draft review](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/accessibility/pull/9#issuecomment-1184017454). There's also been more indepth review on zoom behavior at [quansight-labs/jupyterlab-accessible-themes](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyterlab-accessible-themes/issues).
- Convention to support alt text in notebooks - [github issue](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/issues/98)
  - Mike would like the ways that metadata gets used by tools like nbconvert for things like alt text to be standardized
  - Realted issue at [jupyter/accessibility #37](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/issues/37)
  - Some questions. Should this be a change done on a tool by tool level, or overall? If it is overall, what is the path?
    - Possibly a [Jupyter Enhancement Proposal](https://jupyter.org/enhancement-proposals/) to bring this into nbformat. Possibly the Jupyter Standards group. These will both be slower. There may be faster and just as good changes in nbconvert level.
    - What happens when you work on the individual output level versus the cell level (which may have multiple outputs).
    - Mike: IPython mimebundle adds `alt` to output metadata: https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/9ed8ecd64be967335ce7f098f67aa602a3f3383b/IPython/core/display.py#L1015-L1050
    - Mike: R IRKernel does not add alt to image output metadata: https://github.com/IRkernel/IRdisplay/blob/master/R/display_images.r
    - Mike: width and height metadata are "codified": https://nbformat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format_description.html#display-data
      - Darian: but not formally in https://github.com/jupyter/nbformat/blob/main/nbformat/v4/nbformat.v4.schema.json (which does not prevent the use of `width`, `height` nor `alt`)

### Next steps

- Circle back on next steps for our subproject status: start a council (Isabela)
- from Ryan "should there be a github issue in lab to measure/describe a11y issues with itâ€™s current use of canvas?" Yes! (Isabela)
- Review DataGrid specifically to understand the work that would be needed to make it more accessible (start with a complicated component)
