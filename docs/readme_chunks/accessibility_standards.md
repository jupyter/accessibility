## Links to accessibility standards and resources

One of our goals is to collect information about accessibility and create documentation to empower the Jupyter community to help us make our software accessible. Please use this section to begin to aggregate relevant third party standards, guides, and documentation related to this:

*   [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) - W3C Recommendation
*   [The A11Y Project](https://a11yproject.com/)
*   [18F Accessibility Guide](https://accessibility.18f.gov/)
*   [The tota11y toolbar](https://khan.github.io/tota11y/) is a lightweight javascript toolbar for quick a11y analysis.
*   [The WAVE tool](http://wave.webaim.org/report#/http://z2jh.jupyter.org/) is a web analyzer for page accessibility.
