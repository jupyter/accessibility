### Agenda

* t03857785
    * We are continuing to work on full keyboard access and 400% zoom then will move onto aria labelling and contrast to support additional requirements
    * Tania: dropping the link to the Zoom audit findings and suggested fixes from a few months back https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyterlab-accessible-themes/issues/34
    * Fix skiplink and add placeholder for additional skiplinks https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/14597
    * elements respond to enter or spacebar https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino/pull/590/
    * Added "tabindex=0" for sidebar accessibility https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino/pull/583
    * changing focus is needed for skip links 
      * how do i focus the left/right panel? Make something active (or choose active element) then focus
      * setting active is seperate from focus and current, active does not update focus. Changing focus is a two step process.
* Isabela
    * [JupyterLab accessibility study](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/participate-in-a-jupyterlab-accessibility-study/18786) has been run. I'm handling logistics and working on a wrap up.
    * Space Telescope and rendered notebooks accessibility [most recent study results are up as a PR](https://github.com/Iota-School/notebooks-for-all/pull/56).
* Gabriel
    * Updates since last meeting I attended:
        * Gave a [talk at JupyterCon about accessibility testing](https://cfp.jupytercon.com/2023/talk/8N3PZX/)
        * Created new [JupyterLab test for focus visible](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-a11y-testing/pull/33)
        * As part of getting test in #33 (above) to pass, I've been working on some focus issues with the Lumino MenuBar.
    * I have found a document titled [Developing a Keyboard Interface
](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/keyboard-interface/) from the ARIA Authoring Pratices Guide (APG) to be useful.
* cell semantics - https://github.com/Iota-School/notebooks-for-all/pull/63
* Link from Nick: [1EdTech Guidelines for Developing Accessible Learning Applications](https://www.imsglobal.org/accessibility/accessiblevers/sec3.html)
* Andrii
    * Notebook 7 is close to release, there are still 14 open accessibility problems in issue #6800 (https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/6800). We need to identify which one of them (if any) should be release blockers. During the notebook call we defined release blockers as problems that prevent people from using major features of the Notebook. 

Links to open accessibility PRs that we discussed during call (overtime):
* https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/14597
* https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/14400
* https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/14561
* https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino/pull/590
* https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino/pull/477

Note (Gabriel): I think we will want to stick as close to the UI/UX patterns defined in the [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG) Patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/) when making changes to Lumino or JupyterLab
