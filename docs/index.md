# Project Jupyter Accessibility Working Group

Welcome to the Github repository for the accessibility working group of [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). This group was formed in early 2019. Its goal is to gather stakeholders who can actively work with the project to make Jupyter's core user-facing software accessible. In particular, the initial targets are:

*   [Classic Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook)
*   [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab)
*   [JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub)

In March 2019, this software was not accessable. As of April 2022, significant work is still required to reach that goal.

If you are trying to use Jupyter tools with assistive technology now, you may be able to get basic support with the following:
- [Jupyter Notebook a11y toolbar](https://github.com/uclixnjupyternbaccessibility/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/tree/master/src/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/nbextensions/accessibility_toolbar) (from Microsoft research)
- Make cells editable with a screen reader using the [NVDA Browser Nav add-on](https://addons.nvda-project.org/addons/browsernav.en.html#:~:text=BrowserNav%20addon%20for%20NVDA,comments%20or%20malformed%20HTML%20tables.‚Äù)

# `jupyter` accessibility statement

As of Jan 31, 2022, `jupyterlab` nor `retrolab` meet WCAG 2.1 Level A compliance. 


## `jupyter` audits

This section includes audits from different stakeholders on `jupyter` products.

* [JupyterLab v2.2.6 WCAG 2.1](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/9399)
* [Jupyter Notebook WCAG 2.0](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/issues/7)


## Links to accessibility standards and resources

One of our goals is to collect information about accessibility and create documentation to empower the Jupyter community to help us make our software accessible. Please use this section to begin to aggregate relevant third party standards, guides, and documentation related to this:

*   [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) - W3C Recommendation
*   [The A11Y Project](https://a11yproject.com/)
*   [18F Accessibility Guide](https://accessibility.18f.gov/)
*   [The tota11y toolbar](https://khan.github.io/tota11y/) is a lightweight javascript toolbar for quick a11y analysis.
*   [The WAVE tool](http://wave.webaim.org/report#/http://z2jh.jupyter.org/) is a web analyzer for page accessibility.
