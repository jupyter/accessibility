### Agenda

* Ely
    * Open Studio Day!
        * https://go.bloomberg.com/attend/invite/jupyter-open-studio-day-august2023/
* Isabela
    * If we have time, I'd like to ask for a little more info on the motivation behind [the draft event proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m5-fiqWVdlqOuKjp4auakG0MMaTii7JdCVyjwKU7uQU/edit?usp=sharing).
        * Tania (not attending, this time is challenging for me): I reviewed this. First thank you for working on this. I'd also appreciate knowing more about the motivation as I do not have clarity and that reflects on the comments.
    * [JupyterLab user testing results are up for review in jupyter/surveys.](https://github.com/jupyter/surveys/pull/27) Looking for review and merge.
    * ðŸŽ‰[Notebooks for all (STScI) user testing results have been merged to jupyter/surveys](https://github.com/jupyter/surveys/pull/26). 
    * ðŸŽ‰The [Notebooks for all (STScI) proposal document is public](https://github.com/Iota-School/notebooks-for-all/blob/main/resources/proposal-astronomy-notebooks-for-all.md). I have a [PR open to add it to jupyter/accessibility's proposal directory](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/pull/136). Looking for review and merge.
    * ðŸŽ‰[JupyterLab accessibility statement has been merged](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/14856).
* Gabriel
    * I've cleared my plate of required deliverables from my job, so I should have a little more self-directed time over the next few weeks.
    * JupyterLab keyboard brainstorming 
        * Seeking input on organizing a group video chat
    * Some stuff I've been working on:
        * Adding a [dev-focussed accessibility page to the JupyterLab docs](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/14426)
        * Moving along [Lumino menu bar focus/hover PR](https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino/pull/607)
        * Testing above PR against a focus visible test so took the [focus-visible test PR](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-a11y-testing/pull/33) out of draft mode
* [notably inaccessible](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03241)
* **T & P**
    * PRs remain open be great to get some more merged
    * Looking at adding tests for
        * 400% zoom
        * keyboard navigation
        * high contrast visibility 
* **Johnson** 
    * I wanted to make mention on the work I've done on the ["accessibility section in the user JupyterLab documentation"](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/14396) and the progress myself and Stephannie are making on the project.
* Mike
    * Should JupyterLab have "accessibility" settings plugin for things we do not want as default?
