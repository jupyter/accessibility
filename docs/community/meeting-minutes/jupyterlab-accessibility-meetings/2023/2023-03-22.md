### Agenda

- Isabela: Updates!
    -  JupyterLab accessibility user research. I'm still in the scheduling phase.
    -  Notebook authoring recommendations.
    -  STScI test two: content write up is on the horizon.
- Gabriel updates
    - [Adding automated Axe-core + Playwright testing to PyData Sphinx Theme](https://github.com/pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme/pull/1260)
    - The other big thing I'm working on is trying to find UX bugs in a somewhat high-risk PR I made against JupyterLab to [remove tab traps from the Notebook area](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/14115).
        - One big functional change is that browser focus goes on cell wrappers rather than the notebook node itself. This functional change is reflected in a visual change: there is now a bold outline around the notebook cells as you move focus from cell to cell.
- [name=Tony Fast]
    - crash course of links of i presented at pycascades https://tonyfast.github.io/tonyfast/xxiii/2023-03-18-pycascades-ally-talk.html
    - axecon last week:
        - ibm equal access checker ci and extension https://github.com/IBMa/equal-access
            - combines multiple web and national standards
        - https://www.deque.com/axe-con/sessions/the-accessibility-to-burnout-pipeline/
- thoughts about jupyter accessibility
    - cells as forms in lumino
- Sylvain
    - More contributions upcoming
    - What is a good way to collect the work that's been previously done to stop it from getting lost and to help prioritize?
        - Having all the things that have been done collected is too large for the scope of the work coming up.
        - Just being responsive should be enough. (Isabela worries about sustaining this but okay.)
- Mike
   - [GitHub Copilot X](https://github.blog/2023-03-22-github-copilot-x-the-ai-powered-developer-experience/) (just dropped) got voice control; should I move [jupyterlab-voice-control](https://github.com/krassowski/jupyterlab-voice-control) to jupyterlab-contrib? enabling control via via more modalities would be neat
